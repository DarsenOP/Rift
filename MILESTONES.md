## Milestone 1: Foundation & Setup - COMPLETED ✅

### What was accomplished:
- ✅ Go module initialization
- ✅ Project structure setup
- ✅ Makefile with intelligent targets
- ✅ Linter configuration (golangci-lint)
- ✅ Code formatter (gofumpt) 
- ✅ CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
- ✅ Semantic version management
- ✅ Documentation and contribution guidelines
- ✅ Project validation system

### Key Features:
- Smart Makefile that skips unnecessary operations
- Automated quality gates on every PR
- Caching for fast CI runs
- Professional development workflow

## Milestone 2: MVP – Protocol & Human Mode - COMPLETED ✅
What was accomplished:

- ✅ Full RESP2 parser (+, -, :, $, *) with fast ReadLine helper
- ✅ RESP2 writer (all types, nulls, nested arrays)
- ✅ Human-friendly parser (-human flag) – space-separated input auto-converted to RESP arrays
- ✅ Command dispatcher with PING (no-arg ➜ +PONG, one-arg ➜ echo) and COMMAND stub
- ✅ TCP server (:6380 default) with goroutine-per-connection and graceful teardown
- ✅ 100 % unit-test coverage for parser, writer, handler
- ✅ CI workflow runs on feat/mvp; zero lint warnings

Key Features:

- Telnet-friendly REPL: telnet localhost 6380 ➜ PING hello ➜ $5\r\nhello
- Binary accepts -human or -version flags
- Clean separation: internal/resp (protocol), internal/server (commands), cmd/rift (entry point)
- Makefile targets: make build outputs ./bin/rift; make test / make lint pass in < 10 s
