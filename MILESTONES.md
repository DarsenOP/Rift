## Milestone 1: Foundation & Setup - COMPLETED ✅

### What was accomplished:

- ✅ Go module initialization
- ✅ Project structure setup
- ✅ Makefile with intelligent targets
- ✅ Linter configuration (golangci-lint)
- ✅ Code formatter (gofumpt) 
- ✅ CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
- ✅ Semantic version management
- ✅ Documentation and contribution guidelines
- ✅ Project validation system

### Key Features:

- Smart Makefile that skips unnecessary operations
- Automated quality gates on every PR
- Caching for fast CI runs
- Professional development workflow

## Milestone 2: MVP – Protocol & Human Mode - COMPLETED ✅

### What was accomplished:

- ✅ Full RESP2 parser (+, -, :, $, *) with fast ReadLine helper
- ✅ RESP2 writer (all types, nulls, nested arrays)
- ✅ Human-friendly parser (-human flag) – space-separated input auto-converted to RESP arrays
- ✅ Command dispatcher with PING (no-arg ➜ +PONG, one-arg ➜ echo) and COMMAND stub
- ✅ TCP server (:6380 default) with goroutine-per-connection and graceful teardown
- ✅ 100 % unit-test coverage for parser, writer, handler
- ✅ CI workflow runs on feat/mvp; zero lint warnings

### Key Features:

- Telnet-friendly REPL: telnet localhost 6380 ➜ PING hello ➜ $5\r\nhello
- Binary accepts -human or -version flags
- Clean separation: internal/resp (protocol), internal/server (commands), cmd/rift (entry point)
- Makefile targets: make build outputs ./bin/rift; make test / make lint pass in < 10 s

## Milestone 3: Storage Engine & Basic Commands - COMPLETED ✅

### What was accomplished:

- ✅ Thread-safe in-memory store with global RWMutex
- ✅ SET command with basic functionality
- ✅ GET command with proper error handling
- ✅ DEL command for key removal
- ✅ EXISTS command for key existence checking
- ✅ EXPIRE/TTL commands for expiration management
- ✅ Per-key expiration engine with background janitor
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage for all commands

### Key Features:

- Global RWMutex locking strategy
- Expiration system with background cleanup
- Full command suite for basic key-value operations
- Robust error handling and edge case coverage

## Milestone 4: Concurrency & Resilience - COMPLETED ✅

### What was accomplished:

- ✅ Performance benchmarks (240k+ SET ops/sec, 265k+ GET ops/sec)
- ✅ Graceful shutdown implementation
- ✅ Signal handling for SIGINT/SIGTERM
- ✅ ADR documenting global RWMutex decision
- ✅ Comprehensive benchmark documentation
- ✅ CI integration for concurrency testing

### Key Features:

- Micro-benchmarks and redis-benchmark stress tests
- Zero panics, zero goroutine leaks under load
- p99 latency < 0.3ms performance baseline
- Connection draining with configurable timeout
- Production-ready signal handling

## Milestone 5: Advanced Data Types & Commands - IN PROGRESS ⏳

### Planned Features:

- Refactor storage to support multiple data types (`map[string]interface{}`)
- List commands: LPUSH, RPUSH, LPOP, RPOP, LRANGE, LLEN
- Hash commands: HSET, HGET, HGETALL, HDEL, HEXISTS, HLEN
- Set commands: SADD, SMEMBERS, SISMEMBER, SREM, SCARD, SINTER
- Type commands: TYPE, RENAME, RENAMENX

### Expected Branches:

- `feat/data-types-refactor`
- `feat/list-commands`
- `feat/hash-commands`
- `feat/set-commands`
- `feat/type-commands`

- AOF (Append Only File) persistence
- Background saving
- Snapshot recovery
- Configurable persistence modes

## Milestone 7: Cluster Ready & Production Features - PLANNED 📅

### Planned Features:

- Redis protocol compatibility validation
- Client library compatibility testing
- Performance optimization
- Memory management improvements
